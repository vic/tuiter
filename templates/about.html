          <h2>About Tuiter 2006</h2>
          <p class="lead">A small, text-first social place inspired by how the web used to feel: conversational, quick, and focused on people — not on attention optimization.</p>

            <h3>Why this exists</h3>
            <p>
              Modern social platforms increasingly prize content that maximizes attention. Endless short-form feeds and attention-optimized placements make conversation noisy and transactional. Tuiter 2006 is a deliberate counterpoint: simple, text-first, and tuned for readable exchange where people come to speak and listen, not to be optimized for ad dollars.
            </p>

            <h3>Text first, always</h3>
            <p>
              Text scales well: it’s quick to skim, easy to quote, and friendly to thoughtful replies. By keeping the interface lightweight and avoiding media-first mechanics we make it easy to follow conversations and participate without distraction.
            </p>

            <h3>Obsolete by design</h3>
            <p>
              This project embraces minimalism. It is intentionally old-fashioned so the social experience — voices, replies, and threads — stays front and center. That obsolescence is the feature: fewer bells and whistles, more room for people.

            <h3>What people do here</h3>
            <p>
              People use Tuiter 2006 to jot quick thoughts, follow conversations, reply, and collect small threads of discussion. It favors readable text over polished feeds and keeps interactions light and human.

            <h3>Share with friends</h3>
            <p>
              If this appeals to you, please tell a friend. Word-of-mouth sharing — a copied link, some screenshots of what you like or a short post on your other accounts, or an invitation to someone who loves old fashioned text conversation — is the best way to grow a calm, thoughtful community.
